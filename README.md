# Raspberry-JY901-Serial

## JY901 IMU Serial connection for Raspberry based on wiringPi

### JY901 is a IMU made by Wit-Motion Company.
The original is based on [arduino-JY901](https://github.com/paul-tian/Arduino-JY901-Serial) which contains both Serial and IIC connection implementation for Arduino mikrocontroller.
This repo has only Serial implemented for now, might get around to implement II2.
However for now school has full priority.
